Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no
elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a
subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

public class LongestIncreasingSubsequence {
    /*
tails is an array storing the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences with length i+1 in tails[i].
For example, say we have nums = [4,5,6,3], then all the available increasing subsequences are:

len = 1   :      [4], [5], [6], [3]   => tails[0] = 3
len = 2   :      [4, 5], [5, 6]       => tails[1] = 5
len = 3   :      [4, 5, 6]            => tails[2] = 6
We can easily prove that tails is a increasing array. Therefore it is possible to do a
 binary search in tails array to find the one needs update.

Each time we only do one of the two:

(1) if x is larger than all tails, append it, increase the size by 1
(2) if tails[i-1] < x <= tails[i], update tails[i]
Doing so will maintain the tails invariant. The the final answer is just the size.
